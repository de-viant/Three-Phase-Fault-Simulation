# Three-Phase-Fault-Simulation
This project includes two .slx files (Simulink). the short transmission line model can be used to calculate voltage regulation and efficiency for different paramaters of the transmssion line.
The three phase fault model is used to simulate both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in a generic transmssion line using the 'three phase fault block' in SIMULINK.
